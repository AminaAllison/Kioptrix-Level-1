<h1>Kioptrix Level 1 PenTest Report</h1>


<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
The penetration testing of Kioptrix Level 1 machine was conducted in order to assess its security posture. The testing was conducted using a variety of tools and techniques, including enumeration, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation. The results of the testing indicate that the machine is vulnerable to a number of common attack vectors, including outdated software versions, weak credentials, and misconfigured services. The vulnerabilities identified in the testing pose a significant risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the machine and its associated data. The machine was successfully compromised using a Samba version 2.2.1a exploit, resulting in root-level access.
<br />


<h2>Scope and Methodology</h2>
The scope of this penetration testing engagement was limited to the Kioptrix Level 1 machine. The testing was conducted using a combination of automated tools and manual techniques. The testing was conducted in a controlled environment, and every effort was made to minimize any impact on the availability or stability of the machine.
<br />


<h2>Findings</h2>
The following vulnerabilities and weaknesses were identified during the course of the penetration testing:
<br />
Outdated Software: The Kioptrix Level 1 machine is running outdated versions of software, including Apache 2.0.52, PHP 5.0.4, and MySQL 4.1.20. These versions are known to have several vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.
<br />
Weak Credentials: The default username and password for the MySQL database (root:password) was left unchanged, which allowed us to gain access to the database and extract sensitive information.
<br />
Misconfigured Services: The PHPMyAdmin installation on the machine was not properly secured, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database and execute arbitrary code on the server.
<br />
Samba Exploit: The Samba version 2.2.1a exploit was successfully used to gain root-level access to the machine. The exploit allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges, effectively compromising the entire system.
<br />


<h2>Recommendations</h2>
Based on the findings of this penetration testing engagement, the following recommendations are made to improve the security posture of the Kioptrix Level 1 machine:
<br />
Update Software: All software on the machine should be updated to the latest stable versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
<br />
Change Default Credentials: The default username and password for the MySQL database should be changed to a strong, unique password.
<br />
Secure PHPMyAdmin: The PHPMyAdmin installation should be properly secured, including the use of strong passwords, SSL encryption, and access control lists.
<br />
Patch Samba: The Samba version 2.2.1a exploit should be patched to prevent attackers from gaining root-level access to the machine.
<br />


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The penetration testing of the Kioptrix Level 1 machine revealed several vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. These vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the machine and its associated data. The Samba version 2.2.1a exploit was successfully used to gain root-level access to the machine, highlighting the need for prompt patching of known vulnerabilities. The recommendations outlined in this report should be implemented as soon as possible to improve the security posture of the machine and mitigate the risk of attack.
